## Open Points & Enhancement Tasks

Based on testing and code review, here are the identified open points and suggested enhancements:

### Critical Issues

1. **Port configuration mismatch**
   - Status: Fixed ✅
   - Description: Scripts were using port 443, but the server is running on port 444
   - Solution: Updated scripts to use the correct port (444) by default
   - Priority: High

2. **Missing ISOs**
   - Status: Issue detected
   - Description: The ISO check failed - OpenShift installation ISOs are not available at the expected location
   - Solution: Generate and upload ISOs for each supported OpenShift version
   - Priority: High

### Feature Enhancements

3. **Complete netboot.xyz integration**
   - Status: Completed ✅
   - Description: Added netboot support using custom URL (https://netboot.omnisack.nl)
   - Tasks:
     * ✅ Added 'netboot' as a method option in switch_openshift.py
     * ✅ Implemented UEFI HTTP boot configuration 
     * ✅ Created setup_netboot.py for custom OpenShift menu
   - Priority: High

4. **Multiple server orchestration**
   - Status: Partial
   - Description: Current scripts support specifying servers individually, but lack batch operations
   - Tasks:
     * Add capability to configure multiple servers simultaneously
     * Implement parallel execution for faster deployment
     * Create server group configuration files
   - Priority: Medium

5. **Boot disk backup/restore**
   - Status: Not implemented
   - Description: No functionality to backup, snapshot or restore boot disks
   - Tasks:
     * Implement ZFS snapshot creation for boot disks
     * Add clone functionality for quick duplication
     * Create snapshot scheduling and rotation
   - Priority: Medium

6. **Unified command interface**
   - Status: Not implemented
   - Description: Currently using multiple scripts with different parameters
   - Tasks:
     * Create a unified CLI tool with subcommands
     * Standardize parameter naming across all operations
     * Add interactive mode with guided prompts
   - Priority: Medium

### Code Improvements

7. **Consistent connection parameters**
   - Status: Fixed ✅
   - Description: Scripts were using different methods to connect to TrueNAS 
   - Solution: Standardized connection handling to use port 444 across all scripts
   - Priority: High

8. **Refactor command execution**
   - Status: Could be improved
   - Description: Many scripts use direct subprocess calls to other Python scripts
   - Solution: Refactor into proper Python modules with shared core functionality
   - Priority: Medium

9. **Improve error handling**
   - Status: Basic
   - Description: Current error handling is minimal, especially for network and API failures
   - Solution: Implement comprehensive error handling with specific error types and recovery strategies
   - Priority: Medium

10. **Implement logging framework**
    - Status: Not implemented
    - Description: Currently using print statements for output
    - Solution: Replace with proper Python logging framework with configurable levels
    - Priority: Medium

### Documentation & Testing

11. **Create network requirements document**
    - Status: Not available
    - Description: Missing documentation on network requirements
    - Tasks:
      * Document all required ports and protocols
      * Create network topology diagram
      * Add firewall configuration guidance
    - Priority: Low

12. **Add automated testing**
    - Status: Basic test scripts available
    - Description: Test coverage is limited to manual tests
    - Tasks:
      * Create unit tests for core functionality
      * Implement integration tests for key workflows
      * Add CI pipeline for automated testing
    - Priority: Low

## Next Steps

1. Generate and upload OpenShift ISOs for testing:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/generate_openshift_iso.py --version 4.18 --rendezvous-ip 192.168.2.230
   ```

2. Test the complete netboot functionality:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/setup_netboot.py --truenas-ip 192.168.2.245
   ./scripts/switch_openshift.py --server 192.168.2.230 --method netboot --netboot-menu openshift --check-only
   ```

3. Implement the next round of enhancements (in order of priority):
   - Multiple server orchestration
   - Boot disk backup/restore functionality
   - Unified command interface (r630-manager.py)
