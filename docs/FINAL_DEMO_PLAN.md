# OpenShift Multiboot System - Final Demonstration Plan

This document outlines the plan for the final demonstration of the OpenShift Multiboot System to stakeholders. The demonstration will showcase the key capabilities of the system and demonstrate that all project requirements have been met.

## Demonstration Overview

The final demonstration will be a comprehensive walkthrough of the OpenShift Multiboot System. It will demonstrate the three primary boot methods and show the ability to switch between different OpenShift versions on Dell PowerEdge R630 hardware.

## Logistics

- **Date**: TBD (To be scheduled after ISO generation completes)
- **Duration**: 60 minutes
- **Location**: Server Room / Remote video conference
- **Presenters**: System Administrator, Project Lead
- **Audience**: Operations Team, IT Management, OpenShift Administrators

## Required Resources

- Dell PowerEdge R630 servers (192.168.2.230, 192.168.2.232)
- TrueNAS Scale server (192.168.2.245)
- Network access to all servers
- Projection system or screen sharing for remote participants
- Access to iDRAC consoles for demonstration

## Demonstration Agenda

### 1. Introduction (5 minutes)

- Project overview and goals
- System architecture explanation
- Key components and their roles

### 2. iSCSI Boot Demonstration (15 minutes)

- Explain iSCSI boot process and configuration
- Show iSCSI targets on TrueNAS
- Demonstrate switching between OpenShift versions:
  ```bash
  # Switch to OpenShift 4.18
  ./scripts/switch_openshift.py --server 192.168.2.230 --method iscsi --version 4.18 --reboot
  
  # Once booted, show OpenShift version
  
  # Switch to OpenShift 4.17
  ./scripts/switch_openshift.py --server 192.168.2.230 --method iscsi --version 4.17 --reboot
  ```
- Verify boot success via iDRAC console
- Show OpenShift web console access

### 3. ISO Boot Demonstration (15 minutes)

- Explain agent-based installation process
- Show ISO generation process (or pre-generated ISO)
  ```bash
  ./scripts/generate_openshift_iso.py --version 4.18 --rendezvous-ip 192.168.2.232
  ```
- Configure server for ISO boot
  ```bash
  ./scripts/switch_openshift.py --server 192.168.2.232 --method iso --version 4.18 --reboot
  ```
- Show boot process via iDRAC console
- Explain installation process and customization options

### 4. Netboot Demonstration (15 minutes)

- Explain netboot capabilities and configuration
- Show custom menu configuration
  ```bash
  ./scripts/setup_netboot.py --truenas-ip 192.168.2.245
  ```
- Configure server for netboot
  ```bash
  ./scripts/switch_openshift.py --server 192.168.2.230 --method netboot --reboot
  ```
- Demonstrate netboot menu and selection process via iDRAC console
- Show how to select different OpenShift versions from the menu

### 5. Documentation and Administration (5 minutes)

- Overview of documentation structure
- Highlight key administration procedures
- Show CI/CD pipeline in GitHub Actions
- Explain monitoring and maintenance procedures

### 6. Q&A and Handoff (5 minutes)

- Answer questions from stakeholders
- Formal handoff to operations team
- Discussion of future enhancements

## Success Criteria

The demonstration will be considered successful if:

1. All three boot methods are successfully demonstrated
2. Switching between OpenShift versions is shown to be working
3. All stakeholder questions are answered satisfactorily
4. Operations team confirms readiness to take ownership of the system

## Pre-Demonstration Checklist

- [ ] Verify all ISOs are generated and accessible
- [ ] Test all boot methods on demonstration hardware
- [ ] Ensure network connectivity between all components
- [ ] Prepare iDRAC console access for demonstration
- [ ] Rehearse demonstration steps and timing
- [ ] Ensure all documentation is up to date and accessible
- [ ] Prepare handoff documentation for operations team

## Post-Demonstration Actions

1. Gather feedback from stakeholders
2. Document any issues or enhancement requests
3. Complete formal handoff to operations team
4. Update PROJECT_COMPLETION.md to mark final demo as completed
5. Close out project in project management system

## Contingency Plans

### Network Issues

- Have screenshots of successful operations ready to show
- Prepare recorded video of boot processes as backup

### Hardware Issues

- Have multiple servers available for demonstration
- Be prepared to show pre-recorded demos if hardware is unavailable

### Time Management

- Prioritize iSCSI and netboot demonstrations if time runs short
- Prepare abbreviated demo flow if needed

---

This document serves as the plan for the final demonstration of the OpenShift Multiboot System. After successful completion of this demonstration, the project will be considered complete and ready for handoff to the operations team.
