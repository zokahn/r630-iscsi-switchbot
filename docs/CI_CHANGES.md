# CI Implementation Changes and Next Steps

## Changes Made

1. **Created CI Workflow Files**:
   - Created `ci-unit-tests.yml` for matrix testing across Python versions
   - Created `ci-component-tests.yml` for containerized component testing
   - Created `ci-integration-tests.yml` for parallelized integration tests
   - Created `ci-iso-generation.yml` for parallel ISO generation

2. **Fixed Artifact Upload Issues**:
   - Updated all workflows to use `actions/upload-artifact@v4` instead of v3
   - Ensured consistent artifact naming across workflows

3. **Added Documentation**:
   - Created `CI_IMPLEMENTATION.md` outlining the overall CI architecture
   - Created `LINTING_POLICY.md` detailing our non-intrusive linting approach
   - Created `CI_WORKFLOW_TESTING.md` with step-by-step testing instructions
   - Created `CI_FUTURE_ENHANCEMENTS.md` with a roadmap for future improvements
   - Updated README.md with CI section

4. **Added Future Tooling**:
   - Created Dependabot configuration in `.github/dependabot.yml`
   - Added `test_github_workflows.sh` script for easier workflow testing

## Next Steps

1. **Test Workflows**:
   ```bash
   # Test workflows individually or together
   ./scripts/test_github_workflows.sh --unit
   ./scripts/test_github_workflows.sh --component
   ```

2. **Monitor Performance**:
   - Watch matrix jobs to see if parallelization is working
   - Check self-hosted runner usage during workflow runs

3. **Adjust Timeouts and Resources**:
   - Add timeouts to workflows if needed
   - Adjust matrix strategy settings if resources are constrained

4. **Consider These Immediate Enhancements**:
   - Add GitHub status badges to README
   - Create a `.vscode` directory with development settings
   - Add pre-commit hooks for local code quality checks

## Workflow Design Features

### Smart Stages
Each workflow follows a multi-stage pattern:
1. **Preparation Stage**: Validates inputs, sets up environment
2. **Execution Stage**: Runs tests or builds in parallel
3. **Summary Stage**: Collects and reports results

### Matrix Testing
Unit tests use a 6-combination matrix:
- 3 Python versions: 3.9, 3.10, 3.11
- 2 test groups: framework, scripts

### Non-Intrusive Code Quality
As per requirements, linting:
- Only warns, never modifies code
- Doesn't fail builds on style issues
- Generates reports as artifacts for reference

### Containerized Testing
Component tests use Docker Compose to:
- Spin up MinIO and Vault containers
- Run tests in an isolated environment
- Clean up resources after tests complete

## Using GitHub Actions with a Self-Hosted Runner

Self-hosted runners are used for:
- Integration tests that need access to real hardware
- ISO generation that needs x86_64 architecture

Ensure your runner is properly configured and has:
- Python 3.9, 3.10, and 3.11 installed
- Docker and Docker Compose available
- Sufficient disk space for ISO generation
- Network access to test servers and TrueNAS

## How to Get Help

If you encounter issues with the workflows:
1. Check the workflow logs in GitHub Actions
2. Review the artifact reports for more details
3. Consult the CI_WORKFLOW_TESTING.md document for troubleshooting steps
