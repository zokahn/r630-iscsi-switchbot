# Public Release Action Plan

This document outlines the specific actions needed to prepare this repository for public release based on the automated scan results.

## 1. Sensitive Information Cleanup

### Found Issues:

- **Default Credentials in Code**: 
  - `scripts/fix_multiple_iscsi_devices.py` contains default iDRAC credentials (`root/calvin`)
  - Action: Replace with a reference to environment variables or configuration file

- **Example Credentials in Documentation**: 
  - Both versions of `ADMIN_HANDOFF.md` contain example credentials
  - Action: Ensure these are clearly marked as examples and use placeholder values

- **Sensitive Files in Git History**:
  - `scripts/setup_github_secrets.sh` and `scripts/secrets_provider.py` were identified
  - These files match patterns for potentially sensitive content
  - Action: Review these files to ensure they don't contain actual secrets

## 2. Repository Organization

### Found Issues:

- **Markdown Files in Root Directory**:
  - 8 markdown files should be moved to the docs directory
  - Action: Run `scripts/organize_repo_structure.py` to move these files

- **Miscellaneous Files in Root Directory**:
  - Several log files and test files in the root directory
  - Action: Remove temporary log files and consider moving test files to a test directory

## 3. Documentation Consistency

### Found Issues:

- **Logo Usage**:
  - Logo is properly referenced in mkdocs.yml
  - No references to the logo in markdown documentation
  - Action: Consider adding logo to main README.md and key documentation files

## 4. Next Steps

1. **Clean Up Sensitive Information**:
   - Review and fix all identified potential secrets
   - For any secrets that cannot be removed, update to use the secrets provider system

2. **Organize Repository Structure**:
   - Run `scripts/organize_repo_structure.py` to move markdown files to docs directory
   - Remove temporary log files from the root directory

3. **Create New Public Repository**:
   - Use `scripts/create_public_repo.sh` to create a new repository without history
   - This is the safest approach to ensure no sensitive information from history is transferred

4. **Final Review**:
   - Manually review all documentation for completeness and accuracy
   - Test GitHub Pages deployment
   - Verify licensing and attribution

## 5. Post-Release Steps

1. Set up branch protection rules for the main branch
2. Enable GitHub Pages
3. Configure GitHub Actions for CI/CD
4. Add appropriate collaborators

## Conclusion

The automated scan has identified several issues that need to be addressed before making the repository public. Following this action plan will help ensure that the repository is properly prepared for public release.
