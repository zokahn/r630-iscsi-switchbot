### Testing
- ✅ Created `scripts/test_s3_component_py312.py` test script
- ✅ Added Docker-based testing with `scripts/run_py312_tests.sh`
- ✅ Applied isolated testing environment with Docker

## Completed Steps

1. **Updated All Components**
   - ✅ Created `vault_component_py312.py` with Python 3.12 features
   - ✅ Created `openshift_component_py312.py` with Python 3.12 features
   - ✅ Created `iscsi_component_py312.py` with Python 3.12 features
   - ✅ Created `r630_component_py312.py` with Python 3.12 features

2. **Scripts Migration**
   - ✅ Added type annotations to key workflow scripts (`workflow_iso_generation_s3_py312.py`, `setup_minio_buckets_py312.py`, `test_iscsi_truenas_py312.py`, `generate_openshift_iso_py312.py`, and `config_iscsi_boot_py312.py`)
   - ✅ Modified scripts to leverage Python 3.12 features (Pattern matching, TypedDict, dict merging, NotRequired, assignment expressions, Path objects)
   - ✅ Updated script testing for Python 3.12 (Unit tests for all migrated scripts completed with comprehensive mocking and validation)

3. **Additional Testing**
   - ✅ Added Python 3.12 specific unit tests
   - ✅ Created verification system with Docker support
   - ✅ Added comprehensive type checking tests with mypy-boto3-s3 integration

## Implementation Results

### Type Safety Improvements
- Added 5+ typed dictionaries for component configuration and results
- Enhanced function signatures with specific return types
- Improved error handling with proper type annotations
- Used Literal types for string enumerations

### Performance Improvements
- Applied optimized list comprehensions in bucket discovery
- Used Python 3.12 dict merging for faster operations
- Optimized pattern matching for policy verification

### New Python 3.12 Features Used
- Type parameter syntax for generic classes (`GenericComponent[T]`)
- Dict merging with the `|` operator
- Improved pattern matching
- Advanced type annotations with Literal types
- Assignment expressions in comprehensions (`folders = {f"{parts[0]}/" for obj in objects if (parts := obj.key.split('/')) and len(parts) > 1}`)

## Testing Instructions

To test the Python 3.12 implementation:

```bash
# Run S3 component tests in Docker
./scripts/run_py312_tests.sh

# Run with Docker Compose for a full environment
docker-compose -f docker-compose.python312.yml up --build

# Run specific tests
docker-compose -f docker-compose.python312.yml run python312 python scripts/test_s3_component_py312.py
```

## Verification and Deployment

The Python 3.12 migration has been fully verified with the `check_py312.sh` script, which:

1. Runs in a Docker container with Python 3.12.10
2. Installs all necessary dependencies (including mypy-boto3-s3 for type checking)
3. Verifies all 6 components and 5 scripts work correctly
4. Provides a detailed summary of test results

The migration has been successfully merged to the main branch on April 15, 2025, ahead of schedule.
