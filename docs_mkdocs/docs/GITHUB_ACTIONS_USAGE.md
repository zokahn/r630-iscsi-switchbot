# Using GitHub Actions for OpenShift ISO Generation

This document explains how to use GitHub Actions to generate OpenShift ISOs on x86_64 runners, which is particularly useful when developing on non-x86_64 machines (like Apple Silicon Macs).

## Why Use GitHub Actions?

The OpenShift installer is designed for x86_64 architectures, and running it on ARM-based systems (like Apple Silicon Macs) can be problematic and slow. By leveraging GitHub Actions:

1. ISOs are generated on x86_64 GitHub-hosted runners
2. The process is faster and more reliable
3. We avoid architecture compatibility issues
4. The generated ISOs can be uploaded directly to TrueNAS

## Prerequisites

Before using the GitHub Actions workflow, ensure you have:

1. **GitHub CLI Installed**:
   ```bash
   # macOS (Homebrew)
   brew install gh
   
   # Linux
   sudo apt install gh
   ```

2. **GitHub CLI Authenticated**:
   ```bash
   gh auth login
   ```

3. **Required GitHub Secrets Set Up**:
   - `OPENSHIFT_PULL_SECRET`: Your Red Hat OpenShift pull secret
   - `TRUENAS_SSH_KEY`: SSH private key for TrueNAS access
   - `TRUENAS_KNOWN_HOSTS`: Known hosts entry for TrueNAS server

## How to Configure GitHub Secrets

1. Go to your GitHub repository settings
2. Navigate to "Secrets and variables" â†’ "Actions"
3. Add the following repository secrets:

   - **OPENSHIFT_PULL_SECRET**:
     - Content: Your OpenShift pull secret (from https://console.redhat.com/openshift/install/pull-secret)
     - Format: JSON string

   - **TRUENAS_SSH_KEY**:
     - Content: SSH private key for TrueNAS access
     - To generate:
       ```bash
       ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -f truenas_key -N ""
       # Then copy the public key to TrueNAS
       ssh-copy-id -i truenas_key.pub root@192.168.2.245
       # Use the private key content for the secret
       cat truenas_key
       ```

   - **TRUENAS_KNOWN_HOSTS**:
     - Content: SSH known hosts entry for TrueNAS
     - To generate:
       ```bash
       ssh-keyscan -H 192.168.2.245
       ```

## Using the Workflow

### Method 1: Using finalize_deployment.sh

The simplest way to use the GitHub Actions workflow is through the updated `finalize_deployment.sh` script, which automatically:

1. Triggers the workflow for each OpenShift version
2. Monitors workflow progress
3. Verifies the ISOs are available on TrueNAS

```bash
./scripts/finalize_deployment.sh
```

### Method 2: Manually Triggering the Workflow

You can also manually trigger the workflow using the GitHub CLI:

```bash
# Get your repository name
REPO_NAME=$(git remote get-url origin | sed -n 's/.*github.com[:/]\(.*\).git/\1/p')

# Trigger the workflow for OpenShift 4.18
gh workflow run generate_iso.yml -R "$REPO_NAME" \
  -f version="4.18" \
  -f rendezvous_ip="192.168.2.230" \
  -f truenas_ip="192.168.2.245"
```

Or through the GitHub web interface:

1. Go to the "Actions" tab in your repository
2. Select "Generate OpenShift ISOs" workflow
3. Click "Run workflow"
4. Enter parameters:
   - Version (e.g., 4.18)
   - Rendezvous IP (e.g., 192.168.2.230)
   - TrueNAS IP (e.g., 192.168.2.245)
   - Skip upload (optional)
5. Click "Run workflow"

## Workflow Output

The workflow produces the following outputs:

1. **GitHub Artifacts**: The ISO is uploaded as a GitHub artifact, available for 90 days
2. **TrueNAS Upload**: The ISO is uploaded to TrueNAS at `/mnt/tank/openshift_isos/{version}/agent.x86_64.iso`
3. **HTTP Access**: The ISO is accessible via HTTP at `http://{truenas_ip}/openshift_isos/{version}/agent.x86_64.iso`

## Troubleshooting

If the workflow fails, check:

1. **Workflow Logs**: Examine the workflow logs in GitHub Actions for error messages
2. **Secret Values**: Verify that all secrets are correctly set up
3. **TrueNAS Connectivity**: Ensure the TrueNAS server is accessible from GitHub Actions runners
4. **SSH Key Permissions**: Verify the SSH key has proper permissions on TrueNAS

If you need to debug the workflow locally, you can use the following approach:

```bash
# Run the script with the --skip-upload flag to test ISO generation without uploading
./scripts/generate_openshift_iso.py --version 4.18 --rendezvous-ip 192.168.2.230 --skip-upload
```

## Conclusion

Using GitHub Actions for OpenShift ISO generation provides a reliable, architecture-independent method to prepare ISOs for deployment on Dell PowerEdge R630 servers. This approach is especially valuable for developers using non-x86_64 machines like Apple Silicon Macs.
