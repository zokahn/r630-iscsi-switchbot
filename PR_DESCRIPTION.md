# Python 3.12 Migration Implementation

This PR implements the initial phases of the Python 3.12 migration for the r630-iscsi-switchbot project, setting the foundation for a complete migration.

## Changes Implemented

### Phase 1: Dependency & Documentation Updates
- Updated all dependencies to Python 3.12 compatible versions in `requirements.txt`
- Added new development tools (mypy, pytest-xdist, bandit, safety)
- Created comprehensive migration guide (`docs/PYTHON312_MIGRATION.md`)

### Phase 2: Testing & Environment Setup
- Created Python 3.12 feature test script (`scripts/test_python312_features.py`)
- Developed helper module showcasing Python 3.12 features (`framework/py312_helpers.py`)
- Set up Docker and Docker Compose for isolated testing
- Added Docker container with Python 3.12 for running tests

### Phase 3: Roadmap & Planning
- Created detailed step-by-step implementation plan with timeline
- Documented testing instructions and type annotation guidelines
- Identified risks and mitigation strategies

## Testing Instructions

To test the Python 3.12 environment:

```bash
# Build and run the Python 3.12 test environment
docker compose -f docker-compose.python312.yml up --build

# Run just the Python 3.12 feature tests
docker compose -f docker-compose.python312.yml run python312 python scripts/test_python312_features.py
```

## Next Steps

The next priorities are outlined in `docs/PYTHON312_MIGRATION_NEXT_STEPS.md`:

1. Fix CI pipeline YAML configuration
2. Update base component with type annotations
3. Migrate S3 component to Python 3.12 features
4. Progress with remaining components

## Benefits

This migration delivers:
- Performance improvements (5% overall, 2x faster list/dict comprehensions)
- Enhanced type safety
- Improved developer experience
- Better error reporting
- Future-proofing for the codebase
